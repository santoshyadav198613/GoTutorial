Functions are values too. They can be passed around just like other values.

Function values may be used as function arguments and return values.


FUNCTION CLOSURE

Go functions may be closures. A closure is a function value that references variables from 
outside its body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables; 
in this sense the function is "bound" to the variables.

For example, the adder function returns a closure. Each closure is bound to its own sum variable.
