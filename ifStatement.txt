Go's if statements are like its for loops; the expression need not be surrounded by parentheses ( )
but the braces { } are required.


Like for, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.

Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the if.

(Try using v in the last return statement.)

#ifelse
Variables declared inside an if short statement are also available inside any of the else blocks.

(Both calls to pow return their results before the call to fmt.Println in main begins.)
